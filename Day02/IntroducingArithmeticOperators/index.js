/*
	Challenge: Given two numeric variables,  and , write the following:
	
	Create a variable, 'add', and assign it the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
	Create a variable, 'sub', and assign it result of 'b' subtracted from 'a'.
	Create a variable, 'mul', and assign it the product of 'a' and 'b'.
	Create a variable, 'div', and assign it the result of of 'a' divided by 'b'.
	Create a variable, 'inc', and assign it the preincremented value of 'a'.
	Create a variable, 'dec', and assign it the predecremented value of 'b'.
	
	Note: Do not create variables  and . They have already been declared and initialized by our hidden code checker.

//Do not declare variables `a` and `b`.
//Write your code below this line.

var add = a + b;
var sub = a - b;
var mul = a * b;
var div = a / b;
var inc = ++a;
var dec = --b;
